A World where we have created an aligned AGI.
========================
The advent of AGI will, for the first time, open up the possibility for a species on Earth to become immortal. 
This would come after AGI transits into artificial superintelligence (ASI) through self-improvement. 
ASI would be capable of solving societal and economic problems. ASI could take a number of possible functions in our society. 
It can acts as an oracle answering any complex questions asked by humans, such as:
>"How can I build more efficient aircrafts?"

Also, ASI can act on its own as a sovereign, which is allowed to operate in the world freely, making its own decisions about how best to proceed - Invent a faster, cheaper, and safer way than airplanes for humans to privately transport themselves. 
Armed all the technology superintelligence, ASI would likely be able to solve every problem in humanity. 
The artificial intelligence could first halt global warming by coming up with new ways to generate energy avoiding the use of fossil fuels. This can include the assistance to development of fusion power generation if not functioning yet. World hunger would be solved. 
ASI could use things like nanotech to build meat from scratch that would be molecularly identical to real meat. 
In the end, ASI could allow us to conquer our mortality.

Alternatively, ASI can be a genie which executes any given high-level command, for instance:
>"Use a molecular assemblies to create a more efficient aircraft."

Ageing results from the body cells wearing down and his process can be reversed by repairing damaged cells. 
In the bright future this task would be done by intelligent nanobots in the bloodstream performing countless tasks for human health. 
Furthermore, nanobots would be in charge of delivering perfect nutrition to the cells of the body, intelligently avoiding anything unhealthy to pass through the body. 
In addition, organs could be replaced by super-advanced machine versions that would run forever and never fail. 
All these possibilities will be achieved only if Friendly AI is created. 
When describing AI, the term "friendly" means that AI does not cause harm to humans. 
Friendly AI is designed in such way its motivation aligns with humanâ€™s core values.
